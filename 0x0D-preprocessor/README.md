0x0D. C - Preprocessor
This project, titled "0x0D. C - Preprocessor," focuses on the preprocessor in the C programming language. The preprocessor is a crucial part of the compilation process, handling tasks such as macro expansion, conditional compilation, file inclusion, and more. Understanding and effectively utilizing the preprocessor is fundamental to writing efficient and maintainable C code.

Project Overview
In this project, we explore the various aspects of the C preprocessor, including:

Macros: Defining and using macros to simplify code and enhance code readability.

Conditional Compilation: Using conditional directives to control the inclusion or exclusion of code based on specific conditions.

File Inclusion: Understanding how to include files in a C program using preprocessor directives.

Header Guards: Preventing multiple inclusion of header files using header guards to avoid compilation errors.

Macro Arguments: Handling macro arguments and understanding macro expansion rules.

Stringizing and Token Pasting: Learning about stringizing and token pasting operators in macros.

Project Objectives
Gain a comprehensive understanding of how the C preprocessor works and its role in code compilation.
Learn how to effectively use macros to simplify code and improve code maintainability.
Master conditional compilation to control code flow based on specific conditions.
Understand the best practices for file inclusion and header guards to prevent compilation issues.
Explore advanced preprocessor features like stringizing and token pasting.
