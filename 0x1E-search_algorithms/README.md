0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
Welcome to the repository for the "0x1E. C - Search Algorithms" project! In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of search algorithms implemented in the C programming language.

Overview
This repository contains C implementations of various search algorithms, each designed to efficiently locate elements within data structures like arrays. The algorithms covered include:

Linear Search
Binary Search
Jump Search
Interpolation Search
Contents
0-linear.c: Contains the implementation of the linear search algorithm.
1-binary.c: Presents the binary search algorithm, which operates on sorted arrays.
2-jump.c: Features the jump search algorithm, combining linear and binary search principles.
3-interpolation.c: Includes the interpolation search, a more advanced method for sorted arrays.

Getting Started
To utilize these search algorithms:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x1E-search_algorithms.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd 0x1E-search_algorithms

Compile the C files using your preferred C compiler (e.g., GCC):

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o search_algorithms

Execute the compiled program:

./search_algorithms

Follow the on-screen instructions to test different search algorithms.
Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving existing algorithms or wish to add new search algorithms, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request.
