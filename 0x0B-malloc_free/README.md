0x0B. C - malloc, free


The provided README.md describes a set of tasks related to memory allocation and manipulation using C programming language. Here's a summarized and improved description:

##C - Memory Allocation and Manipulation

This project involves creating functions that deal with memory allocation and manipulation in C. Here's an overview of the tasks:

Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee (0-create_array.c)

Create an array of characters and initialize it with a specified character.
The woman who has no imagination has no wings (1-strdup.c)

Return a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory containing a copy of the given string.
He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life (2-str_concat.c)

Concatenate two strings and return a newly allocated space in memory containing the combined strings.
If you even dream of beating me, you'd better wake up and apologize (3-alloc_grid.c)

Return a pointer to a 2-dimensional array of integers, with each element initialized to zero.
It's not bragging if you can back it up (4-free_grid.c)

Free a 2-dimensional grid previously created by the alloc_grid function.
It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe (100-argstostr.c)

Concatenate all program arguments into a single string, separating each argument with a newline.
I will show you how great I am (101-strtow.c)

Split a string into individual words and return them as an array of strings.
Each function is carefully outlined, specifying prototypes and expected behaviors. The functions utilize memory allocation with malloc and deallocation with free. Correct handling of edge cases and potential failures is emphasized.

This summary provides a concise overview of the tasks, highlighting their objectives and outcomes while maintaining clarity and completeness.
