Project 0x0C: C - More malloc, free
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on further understanding and implementing memory allocation and deallocation in the C programming language using malloc and free. It builds upon the knowledge gained in previous projects related to dynamic memory management.

Learning Objectives
Enhance understanding of memory allocation and deallocation using malloc and free.
Learn to allocate memory for multi-dimensional arrays dynamically.
Understand how to use calloc and realloc for memory allocation and reallocation.
Grasp the concept of 'exit status' and how to use it to determine program success or failure.
Tasks
The project is broken down into several tasks, each focusing on specific aspects of memory allocation, deallocation, and related concepts.

Malloc

Implement a function that allocates memory using malloc.
Free

Create a function that frees a previously allocated memory block using free.
Array Range

Write a function that creates an array of integers and initializes it with specific values.
Realloc

Develop a function that reallocates a memory block using realloc.
How to Use
Each task will have its own set of instructions and requirements. To use this project, follow the instructions provided for each task and implement the required functions accordingly. Compile the source code and run the resulting executable to test the functionality.
