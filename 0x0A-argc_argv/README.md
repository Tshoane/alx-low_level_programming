Project Title: 0x0A - C: argc, argv
This project explores the fundamental concepts of command-line argument passing in the C programming language using the argc and argv parameters. Understanding these concepts is pivotal for creating efficient and versatile C programs that can accept input and options from the command line.

In this project, we delve into the workings of argc (argument count) and argv (argument vector) to effectively handle various inputs passed to the program. The knowledge gained here sets the foundation for building robust and interactive C applications, making this project an essential learning experience for aspiring C programmers.
