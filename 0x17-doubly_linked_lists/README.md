Doubly Linked Lists in C
Overview
This project delves into the implementation of doubly linked lists in the C programming language. A doubly linked list is a fundamental data structure consisting of nodes, each containing a reference to both the previous and next nodes, enabling efficient traversal in both directions.

Features
Node Structure: Defines a structure for nodes containing data and pointers to the previous and next nodes.
Insertion and Deletion: Functions to add and remove nodes at the beginning, end, or at specific positions within the list.
Traversal: Methods to traverse the list forwards and backwards, allowing access to each element.
Search: Capability to find elements within the list based on their value.
Modification: Functions to update or modify data within the nodes.
Implementation
The implementation follows a modular approach, separating functionalities into different C files for clarity and ease of understanding.

Files
main.c: Contains the main program demonstrating the usage of doubly linked lists.
doubly_linked_list.c: Implements the core functionalities of the doubly linked list.
doubly_linked_list.h: Header file declaring the structures and function prototypes.
Usage
To use this implementation of doubly linked lists:

Include the doubly_linked_list.h header file in your C program.
Compile the program by linking the doubly_linked_list.c file along with your main program file.
Example
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#include "doubly_linked_list.h"

int main() {
    // Initialize a doubly linked list
    struct Node *list = NULL;

    // Insert elements into the list
    insertAtEnd(&list, 5);
    insertAtEnd(&list, 10);
    insertAtEnd(&list, 15);

    // Display the elements in the list
    printf("List elements: ");
    display(list);

    // Perform other operations...

    return 0;
}
